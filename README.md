> How much faster could your Python code run (if you used 100s of thread workers)?
>
> The ThreadPoolExecutor class provides modern thread pools for IO-bound tasks.
>
> This is not some random third-party library, this is a class provided in the Python standard library (already installed on your system).
>
> This is the class you need to make your code run faster.
>
> There's just one problem. No one knows about it (or how to use it well).
>
> Introducing: "Python ThreadPoolExecutor Jump-Start". A new book designed to teach you thread pools in Python, super fast!
>
> You will get a rapid-paced, 7-part course to get you started and make you awesome at using the ThreadPoolExecutor.
>
> Including:
>
> * How to create thread pools and when to use them.
> * How to configure thread pools including the number of threads.
> * How to execute tasks with worker threads and handle for results.
> * How to execute tasks in the thread pool asynchronously.
> * How to query and get results from handles on asynchronous tasks called futures.
> * How to wait on and manage diverse collections of asynchronous tasks.
> * How to develop a concurrent website status checker that is 5x faster than the sequential version.
>
> Each of the 7 lessons was carefully designed to teach one critical aspect of the ThreadPoolExecutor, with explanations, code snippets and worked examples.
>
> Each lesson ends with an exercise for you to complete to confirm you understood the topic, a summary of what was learned, and links for further reading if you want to go deeper.
>
> Stop copy-pasting code from StackOverflow answers.
>
> Learn Python concurrency correctly, step-by-step.
